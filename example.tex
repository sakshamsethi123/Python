\section{Statement}
$n^4 + 4^n$ is composite for all $n>1$. 

\section{Proof}
Let $m=n^4 + 4^n$. We have to prove $m$ isn't prime. \\

If $n$ is even, then $n^4$ and $4^n$ are both even, making $m$ even as well. An even number is divisible by $2$, so it isn't prime. \\

If $n$ is odd, then let $n=2k+1$ for some positive integer $k$. Now, $m=n^4 + 4^n=n^4 + 4^{2k+1}=n^4 + (4\times 4^{2k}) = n^4 + 4(2^k)^4$. That last expression $n^4 + 4(2^k)^4$ is of the form $n^4 + 4b^4$. Since  $n^4 + 4b^4 = (n^2 + 2b + 2b^2)(n^2 - 2b + 2b^2)$ and $n$ and $b$ are both positive integers, $m$ cannot be prime. $\square$\\





\section{Extension}
\subsection{Statement}
$n^i + i^n$ is not composite for \textit{\textbf{all}} $n>1$ and $i \neq 4$.

\subsection{Understanding the Extension's statement }
We need to take some time and really understand the statement of the extension because it isn't very obvious what it means. Specifically, we need to understand what "ALL" means here. A misconception of it's meaning might be: "$n^i + i^n$ is not composite for  \textit{\textbf{any}} $n>1$ and $i \neq 4$." \\

However, the real meaning of it is: "$n^i + i^n$is not composite for \textbf{\textit{all}} $n>1$ and $i \neq 4$, but it might be for some."


\subsection{Examples}
Let's take some examples to get an idea of where we're headed. \\

When $i=2$, we have $n^2 + 2^n$, which is prime (not composite) when $n=2$. \\

When $i=3$, we have $n^3 + 3^n$, which is prime when $n=3$.\\

We're not allowed to have $i=4$, though, since it really is composite for \textbf{\textit{all}} $n>1$. \\

When $i=5$, we have $n^5 + 5^n$, which is prime when $n=3$.
