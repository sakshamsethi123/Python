Welcome to Saksham Sethi's coding practice, and this is my repository called "PYTHON 3".
Well, obviously, I practice python here. This is my first coding language.
I'm a 6th grader at Carnage Middle School, but these days we have summer break.
I am utilizing this time to do a lot of math, physics, and coding (python 3)
Bye, and thanks for reading!
